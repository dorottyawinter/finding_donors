    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "#### [Decision Tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)\n",
    "Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise constant approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I choosed DecisionTreeClassifier because I wanted to test a model, which does not obviously generalize the data so well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths**\n",
    "- Simple to understand and to interpret.\n",
    "- The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "- Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalization, dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses**\n",
    "- Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalize the data well.\n",
    "- Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated.\n",
    "- Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate.\n",

    "Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "I choosed SVC() because I wanted to test a model, where I can tune many hyperparametes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths**\n",
    "- Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "- Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "- Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses**\n",
    "- If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial.\n",
    "- SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation (see Scores and probabilities, below).\n",

    "An AdaBoost classifier is a meta-estimator that begins by fitting a classifier on the original dataset and then fits additional copies of the classifier on the same dataset but where the weights of incorrectly classified instances are adjusted such that subsequent classifiers focus more on difficult cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "I choosed AdaBoostClassifier() because I wanted to test a boosting algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths**\n",
    "- Very good use of weak classifiers for cascading.\n",
    "- Different classification algorithms can be used as weak classifiers.\n",
    "- Compared to bagging algorithms, AdaBoost fully considers the weight of each classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses**\n",
    "- The number of AdaBoost iterations is a poorly set number of weak classifiers, which can be determined using cross-validation.\n",
    "- Imbalanced data leads to a decrease in accuracy.\n",
    "- Training is time consuming.\n",

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
